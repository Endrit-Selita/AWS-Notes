# AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) â€“ Comprehensive DevOps Notes

---

## Lesson 15. IAM Introduction

### What is IAM?

**IAM (Identity and Access Management)** is arguably the most important service in AWS. If you're going to work with AWS in any capacity, IAM is something you'll use constantly. It's the security system that controls access to your entire AWS account.

### Core IAM Components

### Users and Groups

**Users** represent individual people or services that need access to AWS resources. Each user gets their own login credentials and specific permissions based on their role.

**Groups** are collections of users who share the same permissions. Instead of configuring permissions for each person individually, you create groups like "Developers," "Operations," or "Audit Team" and assign permissions to the entire group.

This approach makes permission management much more efficient. Rather than setting up permissions for each person individually, you assign them to groups with appropriate permissions already configured.

### Policies

**Policies** are the rulebooks that define exactly what users or groups can and cannot do in AWS. These are written in JSON format, but you don't need to write them from scratch as AWS provides many pre-built templates.

Policies control things like whether a user can create S3 buckets, launch EC2 instances, or access certain data. They can be extremely granular, giving you precise control over what each user or service can do.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**MFA** is a critical security feature that adds an extra layer of protection to your AWS accounts. With MFA, users need both their password and a second form of identification, like a code from an app on their phone.

### Access Control and Temporary Permissions

IAM makes it easy to manage permissions whether you're handling access for one person or an entire team. You can provide temporary access through **roles**, which is useful when you need to allow external users or services to access certain resources without giving them permanent credentials.

---


## Lesson 16. Users \& Groups

### The Root Account Problem

When you create a new AWS account, a **root account** is automatically created. This account has unlimited access to everything in AWS, but here's the critical point: you should never use or share the root account for day-to-day tasks.

Think of the root account like having a master key to your entire house. You wouldn't give everyone the master key, and ideally, it should be locked away safely for emergencies only.

### Individual User Creation

Instead of using the root account, create individual users for each person in your organisation. Each user gets their own login credentials and specific permissions based on their role.

### Group Organisation Structure

Groups make user management much more efficient and organised. Here's how they work in practice:

**Example Organisation:**

- **Developers Group:** Michael, Jennifer, and Joey all get development-related permissions
- **Operations Team:** Handles infrastructure and maintenance tasks
- **Audit Team:** Gets read-only access for compliance and monitoring
- **Multiple Group Membership:** Zac belongs to both Audit and Operations teams, inheriting permissions from both groups


### Important Group Rules

Understanding these rules is crucial for proper IAM management:

**Groups Only Contain Users:** You cannot put groups inside other groups (no nested groups like Russian nesting dolls)

**Users Don't Require Group Membership:** Users can exist independently without belonging to any group, though this makes management more complex

**Multiple Group Membership:** Users can belong to multiple groups simultaneously, inheriting all permissions from each group they're in

This system provides excellent flexibility for managing permissions across your organisation without constant individual adjustments.

---


## Lesson 17 \& 18. Users \& Groups Demo

### Practical IAM Setup Process

### Accessing the IAM Console

Navigate to the IAM console through the AWS Management Console. You can search for "IAM" or find it in the recently visited services. When you first access IAM, you'll see an empty dashboard if you're logged in with the root account.

### Creating Groups First

**Best Practice:** Always create groups before creating users, as this makes permission management much more efficient.

**Group Creation Process:**

1. Navigate to "User Groups" section
2. Click "Create a group"
3. Name the group appropriately (e.g., "admin" for administrative access)
4. Assign appropriate permissions to the group
5. Create the group

### User Creation and Assignment

**User Creation Steps:**

1. Go to "Users" section and click "Create user"
2. Provide a username (e.g., "test-user-1")
3. Configure access type (console access, programmatic access, or both)
4. Set up password requirements
5. Optionally add the user to groups during creation

### Permission Inheritance Demonstration

Once users are added to groups, they automatically inherit all permissions assigned to those groups. This inheritance can happen in two ways:

**Direct Assignment:** Permissions attached directly to a user account
**Group Inheritance:** Permissions inherited from group membership

**Important Testing Tip:** Use private/incognito browser windows to test different user accounts simultaneously. This allows you to log into both the root account and user accounts without constantly logging out and back in.

### Account Alias Creation

You can create an account alias to make the login URL more user-friendly instead of using the default account number. This makes it easier for users to remember and access their accounts.

### Best Practice Recommendations

- **Use IAM users for daily work:** Even for yourself, create an IAM user instead of using the root account
- **Secure the root account:** Keep it protected with MFA and use it only for initial setup and emergency situations
- **Enable MFA for all users:** Especially those with administrative privileges
- **Regular testing:** Periodically test user access to ensure permissions are working correctly


---


## Lesson 19. Permissions

### Understanding IAM Permissions

IAM permissions control exactly what users and groups can do within AWS. This is where you get granular control over your AWS environment.

### How Policies Work

Users and groups are assigned **policies**, which are JSON documents that define their access rights. Policies are detailed instruction manuals that tell AWS exactly what each person is permitted to do.

### Policy Structure and Actions

Policies are built around **actions** that are either allowed or denied. These actions correspond to specific AWS operations.

**Example Actions:**

- **EC2 Actions:** Describe instances, start instances, stop instances
- **S3 Actions:** List buckets, get objects, put objects, delete objects
- **CloudWatch Actions:** List metrics, get metric statistics, create alarms


### The Least Privilege Principle

**AWS Golden Rule:** Always apply the least privilege principle, which means giving users only the minimum permissions they actually need to do their job.

If someone just needs to read data from a database, don't give them the ability to delete it or change settings. Keep things locked down and only allow what's necessary.

### Practical Benefits of Least Privilege

- **Enhanced Security:** Limits potential damage from compromised accounts
- **Reduced Risk:** Prevents accidental deletion or modification of critical resources
- **Compliance:** Meets regulatory requirements for access control
- **Scalability:** As your organisation grows, tight permission control prevents management headaches


### Permission Granularity

IAM allows incredibly detailed control over permissions. You can specify:

- **Which services** a user can access
- **Which specific actions** they can perform within those services
- **Which resources** they can act upon
- **Under what conditions** the permissions apply

Following proper permission management practices keeps your AWS environment secure while ensuring users have sufficient access to perform their jobs effectively.

---


## Lesson 20. IAM Policies Inheritance

### How Permission Inheritance Works

IAM policies inheritance determines how permissions flow from groups to users, creating a flexible and manageable permission system.

### Single Group Membership Example

**Developers Group:** Alice, Bob, and Charles all belong to the developers group. They automatically inherit all permissions assigned to that group.

**Example Permissions:**

- Access to EC2 instances for development environments
- Read/write access to specific S3 buckets for application data
- CloudWatch access for monitoring application performance


### Multiple Group Membership Benefits

**Charles's Enhanced Access:** Charles belongs to both the Developers group and the DevOps team, so he inherits permissions from both groups.

**Combined Permissions Include:**

- All developer permissions (from Developers group)
- Infrastructure management permissions (from DevOps group)
- CloudFormation access for infrastructure as code
- Additional monitoring and deployment capabilities


### Inline Policies for Special Cases

**Fred's Special Situation:** Fred is part of the Operations team but also has an **inline policy** attached directly to his user account.

**Inline Policy Characteristics:**

- **User-specific:** Only applies to that individual user
- **Not shared:** Cannot be attached to groups or other users
- **Additional permissions:** Adds to existing group permissions
- **Special access:** Used for unique requirements that don't fit standard groups


### Multiple Group Examples

**David's Access:** David belongs to both Operations and DevOps teams, inheriting permissions from both groups, giving him a broad range of capabilities across infrastructure and development operations.

### Key Inheritance Principles

**Additive Nature:** Permissions from multiple sources combine together. Users get all permissions from every group they belong to, plus any inline policies.

**No Permission Conflicts:** AWS uses an additive model, so having permissions from multiple sources doesn't create conflicts.

**Flexibility Advantage:** This system allows fine-tuning access without constantly modifying individual user permissions.

### Management Strategy

**Group-First Approach:** Design your permission strategy around groups first, then use inline policies only for exceptional cases where individuals need unique access that doesn't fit standard group patterns.

This approach makes managing permissions across growing teams much more efficient and less error-prone.

---


## Lesson 21. IAM Policies Structure

### Understanding JSON Policy Format

IAM policies are written in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), but don't worry about writing them from scratch. Understanding the structure helps you read and modify existing policies effectively.

### Policy Components Breakdown

### Version

**Always Present:** Every policy starts with a version identifier
**Standard Value:** Usually "2012-10-17" (the date of the current policy language version)
**AWS Stability:** AWS hasn't updated this in years, so consider it a standard header that's always there

### ID (Optional)

**Purpose:** Provides an identifier or name for the policy
**Usage:** Gives extra context or organizational information
**Not Always Present:** You might not see this in every policy

### Statement (The Main Content)

**Core Component:** This is where the actual rules and permissions are defined
**Multiple Statements:** A single policy can contain one or more statements
**Complete Instructions:** Each statement specifies exactly what the policy allows or denies

### Statement Elements Breakdown

### SID (Statement ID)

**Optional Element:** Like a label or tag for each statement
**Organization Tool:** Makes it easier to identify specific parts of complex policies
**Human-Readable:** Helps administrators understand what each section does

### Effect

**Simple Choice:** Either "Allow" or "Deny"
**Clear Decision:** Tells AWS whether to permit or block the specified actions

### Principal

**Who It Applies To:** Specifies which user, role, or account gets these permissions
**Important Concept:** Could be individual users, service roles, or entire AWS accounts
**Permission Target:** Defines the recipient of the access rights

### Action

**Specific Operations:** Lists exactly what the principal is allowed or denied to do
**Service-Specific:** Actions correspond to particular AWS services and operations

**Example Actions:**

- `s3:GetObject` (download files from S3)
- `s3:PutObject` (upload files to S3)
- `ec2:DescribeInstances` (view EC2 instance information)
- `dynamodb:PutItem` (add data to DynamoDB table)


### Resource

**What It Applies To:** Defines which AWS resources the actions can be performed on
**Specific Targeting:** Could be particular S3 buckets, EC2 instances, or other AWS resources

**Example:** An S3 bucket called "my-company-bucket"
**Format:** `arn:aws:s3:::my-company-bucket/*` (Amazon Resource Name)

### Condition (Optional)

**Advanced Control:** Sets up additional rules about when the policy takes effect
**Contextual Restrictions:** Can limit access based on factors like IP address, time of day, or request source

**Example Conditions:**

- Policy only works if request comes from company IP addresses
- Access only allowed during business hours
- Requires specific encryption methods


### Policy Reading Strategy

**Bottom Line Understanding:** A policy defines who can do what to which resource and under what circumstances.

**Pre-built Policies:** AWS provides extensive libraries of pre-made policies, so you rarely need to write them from scratch.

**Modification Skills:** Understanding the structure makes it easier to customize existing policies for your specific needs.

Once you become familiar with this structure, reading and modifying IAM policies becomes much more manageable.

## Lesson 22. IAM Password Policy

### Universal Security Principles

The password policy guidance for AWS applies to any system with login requirements. These are fundamental security practices that protect accounts across all platforms.

### AWS Password Policy Configuration

AWS allows you to set up comprehensive password policies to ensure all users maintain strong, secure passwords across your organisation.

### Minimum Password Length

**Critical Security Measure:** Enforcing minimum password length is essential because short passwords are significantly easier to crack.

**Recommended Minimums:**

- **Absolute minimum:** 8 characters
- **Better security:** 12+ characters
- **Best practice:** Even longer for sensitive accounts

Each additional character exponentially increases the time required to crack a password through brute force attacks.

### Character Type Requirements

**Complexity Requirements:** Mandate a mix of different character types to make passwords substantially harder to guess or crack.

**Required Character Types:**

- **Uppercase letters:** A, B, C, etc.
- **Lowercase letters:** a, b, c, etc.
- **Numbers:** 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.
- **Non-alphanumeric characters:** @, \#, !, \&, %, etc.

This variety makes it exponentially more difficult for attackers to use dictionary attacks or simple guessing methods.

### User Password Management

**Self-Service Capability:** Allow IAM users to change their own passwords whenever necessary, promoting better security hygiene.

**Password Expiration Policy:** Require users to change passwords after specific time periods (e.g., every 90 days).

Regular password changes help limit the impact of compromised credentials by ensuring they don't remain valid indefinitely.

### Password Reuse Prevention

**Anti-Recycling Policy:** Prevent users from reusing their previous passwords, particularly recent ones.

**Common Restriction:** Users cannot reuse their last 5-10 passwords
**Security Rationale:** Prevents the common practice of alternating between two familiar passwords

### Production Environment Considerations

**Enterprise Reality:** In production environments and large organisations, you'll likely rely more on **SSO (Single Sign-On)** or other advanced authentication methods rather than traditional passwords.

**SSO Benefits:**

- Centralized authentication system
- Reduced password-related security risks
- Better user experience with fewer passwords to remember
- Enhanced security monitoring and control

**OAuth and Modern Methods:** Many organizations implement OAuth, SAML, or other modern authentication protocols that reduce reliance on traditional passwords.

### Personal vs Production Accounts

**Personal AWS Accounts:** Create very strong passwords and enable MFA for your personal learning and development accounts.

**Production Environments:** Expect to use SSO or enterprise authentication systems integrated with your company's identity management infrastructure.

---


## Lesson 23. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

### Why MFA is Critical

MFA is one of the simplest yet most effective security measures you can implement for your AWS account.

### The High Stakes of AWS Account Security

**Valuable Resources:** Your AWS account contains critical resources, sensitive information, and potentially expensive infrastructure.

**Attack Consequences:** If someone gains unauthorized access, they can:

- Modify or delete your configurations
- Access sensitive data and applications
- Spin up expensive resources (like cryptocurrency mining operations)
- Generate massive bills that you'll be responsible for paying

**Financial Risk:** Unauthorized cryptocurrency mining can result in bills of thousands of pounds within days.

### How MFA Protects You

**Primary Security Benefit:** Even if someone steals or guesses your password, your account remains secure because they also need the second authentication factor.

MFA requires two things for successful login:

1. **Something you know:** Your password
2. **Something you have:** A security device, like an app on your phone that generates one-time codes

### MFA Requirements

**Two-Factor Authentication:** Users need both their password and a second form of identification like a code from the app on their phone.

**Essential for Root Account:** It's especially important to protect your root account because that's the account with unlimited access to everything.

### Implementation Priority

**Early Setup Recommended:** Set up MFA as early as possible in your AWS journey. It's mentioned that MFA should be configured for billing and account access from the very beginning of this module.

MFA is a quick setup that could make the difference between a secure account and a compromised one.

---


## Lesson 24. MFA Device Options in AWS

### MFA Device Types

AWS supports several different MFA devices and options, allowing you to choose based on your preferences and security requirements.

### Virtual MFA Devices

**Smartphone Apps:** These are apps installed on your smartphone like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator, among many others.

**How They Work:** These apps generate one-time codes that you enter alongside your password.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Multiple Tokens:** Store multiple tokens on a single phone, handy if you manage multiple accounts or roles
- **Easy Setup:** Simple to configure and completely free
- **Perfect for most users:** Suitable for the majority of AWS users


### Universal Second Factor (U2F) Security Keys

**Physical Devices:** These are physical security keys that you plug into your computer's USB port.

**Popular Option:** YubiKey by Yubico is a well-known example.

**How They Work:** Just plug the key in, and it authenticates you without needing to enter a code. Simply plug it in and you're authenticated.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Multiple Account Support:** One key can access several accounts
- **No Phone Required:** Works without needing your mobile device
- **Simple Process:** Just tap and log in


### Hardware Key Fob MFA Devices

**Physical Token Generators:** These are physical devices that generate new codes every 30 seconds or so, similar to virtual devices but in hardware form.

**Third-Party Providers:** Provided by companies like Gemalto and other third-party manufacturers.

**Old School Approach:** These represent a more traditional approach to MFA that some organizations still prefer.

**Specific Use Cases:** Great for environments where phones or other electronic devices are not allowed or practical.

### Hardware Key Fob for AWS GovCloud

**Specialized Region:** This is specifically for users in the AWS GovCloud (US region).

**Government Focus:** AWS GovCloud is a specialized AWS region designed for government workloads.

**High Security Standards:** Used where particularly high security standards are required, generating codes similar to other hardware tokens.

### Choosing the Right MFA Option

**Variety of Choices:** AWS provides plenty of options for securing your account, accommodating different preferences and requirements.

**Key Point:** The most important thing is to use MFA. Any of these options will provide the extra layer of security that passwords alone cannot offer.

**Setup Priority:** Make sure to get your account set up with MFA regardless of which option you choose.

---


## Lesson 25. How Can Users Access AWS?

### Three Main Access Methods

There are three primary ways users can interact with and access AWS services, each suited for different use cases and user preferences.

### AWS Management Console

**Web Interface:** This is the familiar web-based interface that most people use when starting with AWS.

**Authentication:** Users log in with their password and ideally use MFA for additional security.

**Use Cases:** Perfect for manual tasks such as:

- Spinning up EC2 instances
- Creating S3 buckets
- Configuring resources manually through the console interface
- Also known as "click ops" (nothing wrong with this approach)


### AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)

**Terminal-Based Tool:** For users who prefer to work from the command line or need to automate tasks, the CLI is the go-to tool.

**Authentication Method:** Access is protected by access keys, not passwords. This is an important distinction to remember.

**Benefits:** Much more hands-off but extremely powerful for scripting and managing resources from your terminal.

**Example Usage:** Commands like `aws ec2 create-instance` allow you to create resources from the command line.

### AWS Software Development Kit (SDK)

**Programming Integration:** If you're a developer or software engineer writing code, the SDK allows you to programmatically interact with AWS.

**Authentication:** Also protected by access keys, similar to the CLI.

**Use Cases:** Typically used by applications that need to interact with AWS services automatically without human intervention.

### Access Key Management

**User Responsibility:** You manage access keys directly through the console, and each user is responsible for managing their own keys.

**Access Key Structure:** Think of access keys as a username and password combination specifically for programmatic access:

- **Access Key ID:** Acts like a username
- **Secret Access Key:** Functions like a password for CLI/SDK access


### Critical Security Point

**Never Share Access Keys:** Just like passwords, access keys and secrets should never be shared with anyone.

**Code Security:** Never commit access keys to your codebase or share them with others.

**Risk of Exposure:** If someone gains access to your access keys, they can:

- Access your AWS account
- Deploy resources
- Perform cryptocurrency mining
- Execute other unauthorized activities you definitely don't want

**Security Best Practice:** Treat access keys with the same level of security as you would any other sensitive credential.

### Choosing the Right Access Method

**Console Access:** Use your password and MFA combination for manual, web-based tasks.

**Programmatic Access:** Use access keys when you need CLI or SDK functionality for automation and development tasks.

---


## Lesson 26. Access Keys

### Understanding Access Key Structure

Access keys consist of two components that work together to authenticate programmatic access to AWS.

### Access Key Components

**Access Key ID:** Acts like your username for programmatic access
**Secret Access Key:** Functions like your password for CLI and SDK authentication

**Important Note:** The examples shown in lessons are fake keys created for demonstration purposes only. Never attempt to use example keys from training materials.

### How Access Keys Work

**Authentication Pair:** These two keys work together to authenticate you when using the CLI or SDK.

**CLI/SDK Requirement:** Both the CLI and SDK require these keys to verify your identity and permissions.

### Critical Security Warnings

### Never Share Access Keys

**Treat Like Passwords:** Access keys should be treated with the same level of security as your login passwords.

**Access Risks:** If someone obtains your access keys, they can perform any action that your permissions allow, including:

- Making changes to your AWS resources
- Deleting critical infrastructure
- Spinning up expensive resources for cryptocurrency mining
- Any other action within your permission scope


### Immediate Response to Compromise

**Deactivation:** If you suspect your keys are compromised, you can immediately make them inactive through the AWS console.

**Key Rotation:** Create new access keys and disable the old ones. This process is called key rotation.

### Proactive Security Measures

**Regular Rotation:** It's considered best practice to rotate access keys periodically, even when they haven't been compromised.

**Real-World Horror Stories:** Many people have accidentally committed access keys to code repositories or shared them inappropriately, resulting in their accounts being compromised and used for unauthorized activities.

### Key Security Reminders

**Code Repository Safety:** Never commit access keys to version control systems like Git.

**No Sharing:** Never share access keys with colleagues or store them in unsecured locations.

**Vigilant Monitoring:** Be extremely careful with where and how you store and use your access keys.

The security of your entire AWS environment can depend on keeping these credentials safe and secure.

---


## Lesson 27. What's the AWS CLI?

### AWS CLI Overview

**AWS CLI** stands for Command Line Interface. It's a powerful tool that allows you to interact with AWS services directly from your terminal or command prompt, eliminating the need to log into the management console for every task.

### Direct API Access

**Public API Integration:** The AWS CLI provides direct access to the public APIs of AWS services.

**Command-Based Control:** You can use straightforward commands to manage AWS resources, such as:

- Managing S3 buckets
- Launching EC2 instances
- Virtually anything else you can accomplish through the console


### Automation Benefits

**Script Development:** One of the most valuable aspects of the CLI is its ability to support automation through scripting.

**Efficiency Gains:** Instead of manually clicking through the console for repetitive tasks (click ops), you can automate jobs with just a few lines of code.

### Practical Examples

**File Upload to S3:** `aws s3 cp localfile.txt s3://my-bucket/`
This command uploads a file from your local system to an S3 bucket quickly and efficiently.

**List S3 Contents:** `aws s3 ls s3://my-bucket/`
This command shows you what's stored in your S3 bucket.

### Open Source Nature

**Community Contribution:** The AWS CLI is open source, meaning you can:

- View the source code on GitHub: https://github.com/aws/aws-cli
- Contribute to its development
- Submit bug reports or feature requests
- Understand exactly how it works


### When to Use CLI

**Perfect Tool For:**

- Users who prefer command-line interfaces
- Automation and scripting requirements
- Faster, more efficient AWS resource management
- Integration with existing scripts and workflows

**Alternative to Console:** The CLI serves as an excellent alternative to using the management console for many tasks, often providing faster and more repeatable results.

---


## Lesson 28. What's the AWS SDK?

### AWS SDK Overview

**AWS SDK** stands for Software Development Kit. It's a comprehensive tool that enables you to interact with AWS services programmatically using your preferred programming language.

### Language-Specific APIs

**Pre-built Libraries:** The SDK essentially provides a collection of language-specific APIs, which are like pre-built libraries designed for different programming languages.

**Wide Language Support:** AWS offers SDKs for numerous programming languages, including:

- **Python**
- **JavaScript**
- **PHP**
- **Node.js**
- **Go**
- **C++**
- And many more specialized languages


### Application Integration

**Direct Service Embedding:** The SDK allows you to embed AWS services directly within your application code.

**Practical Examples:**

- **Web Application File Storage:** If you're building a web app that needs to store files on S3, you can do this directly from your app's code with just a few lines
- **EC2 Management:** Spin up EC2 instances programmatically from within your application
- **No Console Required:** Accomplish AWS tasks without needing to access the management console


### Mobile and Embedded Support

**Mobile Development:** AWS provides dedicated mobile SDKs for:

- **Android applications**
- **iOS applications**

**Specialized Environments:** Support extends to:

- **Arduino projects**
- **Embedded device development**


### Connection to AWS CLI

**Interesting Fact:** The AWS CLI that we discussed earlier is actually built on top of the AWS SDK for Python, called **Boto3**.

**Under the Hood:** When you use the CLI, you're indirectly using the SDK without realizing it. This demonstrates the SDK's power and versatility.

### Development Benefits

**Cloud Integration:** The AWS SDK makes it straightforward to:

- Connect your code to AWS services
- Manage AWS resources programmatically
- Build powerful cloud-integrated applications
- Integrate AWS functionality seamlessly into existing codebases

**Developer Productivity:** Instead of manually managing infrastructure, developers can focus on building application features while leveraging AWS services through simple API calls.

## Lesson 28a. CLI Access Key Demo

### Practical CLI Setup Process

### AWS CLI Installation

**Download and Install:** First step involves downloading the AWS CLI software to your local machine (laptop or computer).

**Verification:** Once installed, verify the installation was successful using the command:

```
aws --version
```

This confirms the CLI is properly installed and shows which version you're running.

### Authentication Configuration

**Initial Setup:** Use the configuration command to set up your credentials:

```
aws configure
```

This command prompts you to enter your access credentials.

### Access Key Creation

**User Access Keys:** You need to create access keys for your IAM user through the AWS console.

**Key Components:** This process generates both:

- Access Key ID
- Secret Access Key


### Testing Your Setup

**Identity Verification:** Once configured, test your setup with:

```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

This command shows you which AWS account and user you're authenticated as.

**User Management:** You can also test with:

```
aws iam list-users
```

This displays all IAM users in your account (if you have the necessary permissions).

### Important Security Notes

**Credential Protection:** The demo emphasizes the importance of keeping your access keys secure and never sharing them publicly.

**Testing Environment:** Always test your CLI setup in a safe environment before using it for production tasks.

---


## Lesson 29. IAM Roles for Services

### Understanding Service-to-Service Access

Sometimes AWS services need to perform actions on your behalf. For example, an EC2 instance might need to read from an S3 bucket, or a Lambda function might need to write logs to CloudWatch.

### The Security Challenge

**Avoid Hard-Coded Credentials:** You never want to hard-code your credentials directly into AWS services. This creates security vulnerabilities and management difficulties.

### IAM Roles Solution

**Temporary Access:** IAM roles provide a secure way to give AWS services temporary access to other AWS services without using long-term credentials like access keys or passwords.

**Secure Permission Granting:** Roles essentially allow your EC2, Lambda, or other AWS services to act on your behalf in a secure, controlled manner.

### Common Use Cases

### EC2 Instance Roles

**Instance-Level Permissions:** When you launch an EC2 instance, you can attach a role to it.

**Service Access:** This role can grant the instance permissions to access:

- S3 buckets for file storage and retrieval
- DynamoDB for database operations
- CloudWatch for logging and monitoring
- Any other AWS services as needed


### Lambda Function Roles

**Function Permissions:** Lambda functions can have roles attached that define what AWS services they can interact with.

**Execution Permissions:** If your Lambda function needs to interact with other AWS services, the attached role provides the necessary permissions to perform those tasks.

### CloudFormation Roles

**Infrastructure Management:** CloudFormation often needs to create and manage resources across multiple AWS services.

**Service Coordination:** Assigning a role to CloudFormation allows it to handle these tasks securely without exposing credentials.

### Security Benefits

**No Credential Exposure:** You don't hard-code any credentials into your services.

**Easy Permission Control:** You can easily control what permissions each service has through role management.

**Temporary Access:** Roles provide temporary credentials that are automatically rotated, improving security.

### Best Practice Implementation

**Service-to-Service Communication:** Whenever one AWS service needs to access another AWS service, use IAM roles for secure, flexible access management.

**Role Assignment:** Always prefer roles over access keys when working with AWS services that need to communicate with each other.

---


## Lesson 30. IAM Security Tools

### IAM Credentials Report

**Account-Level Overview:** This is a comprehensive, account-wide report that provides a complete snapshot of all users in your AWS account and the status of their various credentials.

### What the Report Shows

**Comprehensive User Status:** The report reveals important security information including:

- Which users have access keys configured
- Which users are using MFA for additional security
- When users last changed their passwords
- Overall credential status and health

**Security Monitoring:** This report gives you all the essential security information in one centralized location, making it easy to monitor your account's security posture.

**Best Practice Compliance:** It's an excellent tool for ensuring everyone in your organization is following security best practices.

### IAM Access Advisor

**User-Level Analysis:** This tool works at the individual user level and provides detailed information about user permissions and activity.

### Two Key Functions

**Permission Visibility:** Shows you exactly what services a user has permission to access based on their attached policies.

**Usage Tracking:** Displays when those services were last accessed by the user, providing insight into actual usage patterns.

### Practical Security Benefits

**Permission Cleanup:** This tool is extremely valuable for cleaning up old or unnecessary permissions.

**Example Scenario:** If you discover that a user has permissions to access a particular service but hasn't used it in months, you can safely remove that permission.

**Least Privilege Implementation:** This directly supports the least privilege principle by helping you identify and remove unused permissions.

### Security Management Strategy

**Credentials Report for Overview:** Use the credentials report to get a comprehensive view of your entire AWS account's security status.

**Access Advisor for Details:** Use the Access Advisor to fine-tune individual user permissions and remove unnecessary access.

**Regular Reviews:** Both tools should be used regularly to maintain strong security hygiene across your AWS environment.

These tools provide the visibility needed to keep your AWS account secure by ensuring users have appropriate permissions and are following security best practices.

---


## Lesson 31. IAM Guidelines \& Best Practices

### Root Account Protection

**Minimal Root Usage:** Do not use the root account except for initial account setup. The root account has unlimited access to everything, so once your account is configured, lock it away safely.

**User Account Alternative:** Use IAM users with appropriate permissions for all daily activities instead of the root account.

### User Account Management

**One Person, One Account:** Follow the rule of one physical user equals one AWS user. Never share login credentials between people.

**Individual Accountability:** Each person should have their own account to maintain traceability and security.

### Group-Based Permission Management

**Use Groups Effectively:** Always assign users to groups and assign permissions to those groups rather than individual users.

**Scalability Benefits:** This approach makes managing permissions much easier and more scalable as your team grows.

### Strong Password Policy Implementation

**Enforce Security Standards:** Create a robust password policy that includes:

- Minimum password length requirements
- Mix of character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
- Regular password change requirements


### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**Universal MFA Requirement:** Enforce MFA for all users you manage, especially those with access to sensitive resources.

**Additional Security Layer:** MFA provides crucial protection even if passwords are compromised, keeping accounts secure through the second authentication factor.

### Service Authentication

**Use IAM Roles:** For services like EC2 or Lambda, always create and use IAM roles rather than hard-coding credentials.

**Security and Control:** Roles provide better security and more granular control over what services can access.

### Programmatic Access Management

**Access Key Security:** When using CLI or SDK for programmatic access, use access keys but treat them with the same security as passwords.

**Key Protection:** Keep access keys secure, rotate them regularly, and never share them.

### Regular Permission Auditing

**Ongoing Review:** Regularly audit permissions using tools like:

- IAM Credentials Report for account-wide overview
- IAM Access Advisor for individual user analysis

**Permission Cleanup:** Use these tools to identify and remove unnecessary permissions, maintaining the principle of least privilege.

### Golden Security Rule

**Never Share Credentials:** Never share IAM users or access keys. Everyone should have their own credentials, and access keys should remain private.

**Individual Responsibility:** Each person is responsible for the security of their own credentials.

### Foundation for Success

Following these best practices creates a solid foundation for managing IAM in AWS and provides security standards that work effectively in real-world environments.

## Lesson 32. IAM Summary

### Core IAM Components Recap

### Users

**Individual Identity:** Each user is mapped to a physical person and has their own password for accessing the AWS Management Console.

**Personal Credentials:** Every user maintains individual login credentials for accountability and security.

### Groups

**User Collections:** Groups contain only users and cannot contain other groups (no nested groups).

**Management Efficiency:** Assigning permissions to groups rather than individuals makes access management much more efficient and scalable.

### Policies

**Permission Documents:** These are JSON documents that define exactly what actions users or groups can take on AWS resources.

**Access Control:** Policies specify who can do what within your AWS environment.

### Roles

**Service Permissions:** Roles grant permissions to AWS services like EC2 instances or Lambda functions, allowing them to interact with other AWS resources on your behalf.

**Secure Service Communication:** Roles also enable users and groups to assume additional permissions temporarily when needed.

### Security Implementation

### Password Policy

**Account Protection:** Establish strong password policies to ensure all users maintain secure login credentials.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**Enhanced Security:** Enforce MFA to add an essential extra layer of protection beyond just passwords.

### Access Methods

### AWS CLI

**Command Line Management:** The AWS CLI allows you to manage AWS services using terminal commands, perfect for automation and scripting.

### AWS SDK

**Programmatic Integration:** The SDK enables you to manage AWS services through various programming languages, integrating AWS functionality directly into your applications.

### Additional Tools

**Infrastructure Management:** Services like Terraform can also manage AWS resources on your behalf, providing infrastructure as code capabilities.

### Programmatic Access

**Access Keys:** These credentials allow programmatic access to AWS through CLI, SDK, Terraform, and similar tools.

**Security Critical:** It's absolutely essential to keep access keys secure and treat them with the same care as passwords.

### Audit and Monitoring Tools

### IAM Credentials Report

**Account Overview:** Provides comprehensive visibility into credential status across your entire AWS account.

### IAM Access Advisor

**Usage Analysis:** Shows which resources users can access and when they last used those permissions, enabling you to remove unnecessary access.

**Permission Optimization:** Helps implement the principle of least privilege by identifying unused permissions.

### Comprehensive Security Framework

This high-level overview of IAM provides the foundation for maintaining a secure and well-managed AWS environment. Keep these practices in mind to ensure robust security and efficient access management across your AWS infrastructure.

## Lesson 32a. IAM Demo Summary

### Creating Custom Policies

### Policy Creation Process

**Access IAM Console:** Navigate to the IAM service and select the "Policies" section.

**Create New Policy:** Click "Create policy" to start building custom permissions.

### Service and Action Selection

**Choose Services:** Select the AWS services you want to grant access to (e.g., EC2).

**Define Actions:** Specify what actions are allowed within each service:

- You can choose "All EC2 actions" for full service access
- Or select specific actions for more granular control

**Resource Selection:** Choose which resources the actions apply to:

- Select "All resources" for broad access
- Or specify particular resources for tighter control


### Adding Multiple Services

**Extended Permissions:** You can add multiple services to a single policy (e.g., both EC2 and Lambda permissions).

**Consistent Process:** For each service, repeat the process of selecting actions and resources.

### Policy Format Options

**Visual Editor:** Use the graphical interface for easy policy creation.

**JSON View:** Click the "JSON" button to see the code version of your permissions, useful for understanding the underlying policy structure.

### Policy Finalization

**Naming:** Give your policy a descriptive name (e.g., "Test_Policy").

**Optional Description:** Add a description to explain the policy's purpose.

**Create Policy:** Complete the process, and your custom policy will appear in the policies list marked as "Customer managed."

### Creating and Assigning Roles

### Role Creation Process

**Access Roles Section:** Navigate to "Roles" in the IAM console.

**Create New Role:** Click "Create role" to start the process.

**Trust Relationship:** Choose "AWS account" and select whether the role applies to:

- This account
- Another AWS account


### Policy Assignment

**Attach Policies:** Search for and select the custom policy you created earlier.

**Role Naming:** Give the role a descriptive name (e.g., "AccessEC2Lambda").

**Create Role:** Complete the role creation process.

### Applying Permissions to Groups

**Best Practice:** Rather than assigning policies directly to individual users, assign them to groups for better management.

**Group Process:**

1. Navigate to "User groups"
2. Select the appropriate group
3. Go to "Permissions" tab
4. Click "Add permissions"
5. Select "Attach policies"
6. Choose your custom policy
7. Apply the changes

This approach ensures consistent permission management and makes it easier to handle access control as your team grows.
